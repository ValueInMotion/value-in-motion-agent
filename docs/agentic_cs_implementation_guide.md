## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Automation Too Fast**: Start with high-volume, low-risk tasks
2. **Ignoring Data Quality**: Garbage in = garbage out
3. **Not Training CSMs**: They need to understand and trust AI
4. **Losing Human Touch**: Automate admin, not relationships
5. **Set-It-and-Forget-It**: AI requires ongoing tuning
6. **Siloed Implementation**: CS, Product, Sales must align
7. **Ignoring Customer Preferences**: Some customers hate automation
8. **Not Measuring Impact**: Track everything to prove ROI
9. **Feature Creep**: Focus on 80/20 use cases first
10. **Underestimating Change Management**: People are harder than tech
